    AnimationEffect
</inherits>
<information>
    The KeyframeEffect interface of the Web Animations API lets us
    create sets of animatable properties and values, called keyframes.
    These can then be played using the Animation() constructor.
</information>
<Constructor>
    由animation.effect返回

    KeyframeEffect()
    Returns a new KeyframeEffect object instance,
    and also allows you to clone an existing keyframe effect object instance.
</Constructor>
<Properties>

    KeyframeEffect.target
    Gets and sets the element, or originating element of the pseudo-element,
    being animated by this object. This may be null for animations that
    do not target a specific element or pseudo-element.

    KeyframeEffect.pseudoElement
    Gets and sets the selector of the pseudo-element being animated by this object.
    This may be null for animations that do not target a pseudo-element.

    KeyframeEffect.iterationComposite
    Gets and sets the iteration composite operation for resolving the property value changes of
    this keyframe effect.

    KeyframeEffect.composite
    Gets and sets the composite operation property for resolving the property value
    changes between this and other keyframe effects.
</Properties>
<Methods>

    AnimationEffect.getComputedTiming()
    Returns the calculated, current timing values for this keyframe effect.

    KeyframeEffect.getKeyframes()
    Returns the computed keyframes that make up this effect along with their computed
    keyframe offsets.

    AnimationEffect.getTiming()
    The EffectTiming object associated with the animation containing all the
    animation's timing values.

    KeyframeEffect.setKeyframes()
    Replaces the set of keyframes that make up this effect.

    AnimationEffect.updateTiming()
    Updates the specified timing properties.
