    The ChannelSplitterNode interface, often used in conjunction with its opposite,
    ChannelMergerNode, separates the different channels of an audio source into
    a set of mono outputs. This is useful for accessing each channel separately,
    e.g. for performing channel mixing where gain must be separately controlled on each channel.

    If your ChannelSplitterNode always has one single input,
    the amount of outputs is defined by a parameter on its constructor
    and the call to AudioContext.createChannelSplitter(). In the case that no value is given,
    it will default to 6. If there are fewer channels in the input than there are outputs,
    supernumerary outputs are silent.
