<information>
    The DelayNode interface represents a delay-line;
    an AudioNode audio-processing module that causes a delay between the arrival of
    an input data and its propagation to the output.
    A DelayNode always has exactly one input and one output,
    both with the same amount of channels.

    The DelayNode acts as a delay-line, here with a value of 1s.

    When creating a graph that has a cycle,
    it is mandatory to have at least one DelayNode in the cycle,
    or the nodes taking part in the cycle will be muted.
    Number of inputs 	1
    Number of outputs 	1
    Channel count mode 	"max"
    Channel count 	2 (not used in the default count mode)
    Channel interpretation 	"speakers"

<Constructor>
    DelayNode()
    Creates a new instance of an DelayNode object instance.
    Alternatively, you can use the BaseAudioContext.createDelay() factory method.
</Constructor>
<Properties>
    DelayNode.delayTime Read only
    Is an a-rate AudioParam representing the amount of delay to apply, specified in seconds.
