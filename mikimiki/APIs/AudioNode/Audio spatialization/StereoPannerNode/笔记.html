    The StereoPannerNode interface of the Web Audio API represents a simple stereo panner node that
    can be used to pan an audio stream left or right. It is an AudioNode audio-processing module
    that positions an incoming audio stream in a stereo image using a low-cost equal-power
    panning algorithm.

    The pan property takes a unitless value between -1 (full left pan) and 1 (full right pan).
    This interface was introduced as a much simpler way to apply a simple panning effect
    than having to use a full PannerNode.
