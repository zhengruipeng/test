属性

AudioNode.context 只读
链接到关联的 AudioContext，处理图中模块的上下文对象。

目标节点（如AudioDestinationNode）的此属性的值为0。

AudioNode.channelCount
Represents an integer used in determining how many channels outputs must contains. Its usage and precise definition depends of the value of AudioNode.channelCountMode: it is ignored if the value is "max", used as a maximum value for "clamped-max", or used as the effective value for "explicit".
表示用于确定输出必须包含多少通道的整数。它的用法和精确定义取决于AudioNode.channelCountMode：
如果值为“max”，用作“clamped max”的最大值，或用作“explicit”的有效值，则忽略该值。

AudioNode.channelCountMode
Represents an enumerated value describing the way channels must be matched between the inputs and the outputs. Possible values are:
表示一个枚举值，该值描述通道在输入和输出之间必须匹配的方式。可能的值包括：

    ·Value ：	Description
Used as default for the following AudioNode children
    ·"max" ：	The number of channels is the maximum of the number of channels all connections. That implies that channelCount is ignored and only up-mixing happens
                通道数是所有连接的通道数的最大值。这意味着忽略了channelCount，只有上混才会发生

    ·"clamped-max" ：	The number of channels is the maximum of the number of channels of all
connections, clamped to the value of channelCount. PannerNode, ConvolverNode
信道数是所有连接的信道数的最大值，固定为channelCount的值。 PannerNode，卷积节点
    ·"explicit" ：	The number of channels is defined by the value of channelCount.

AudioNode.channelInterpretation
Represents an enumerated value describing the meaning of the channels. This interpretation will define how the up-mixing and the down-mixing will happen.
The possible values are "speakers" or "discrete". In the case of "speakers", the ordering of the channels have the following meaning, and the channels are often represented by a standard abbreviation:
Mono 	0: M: mono
Stereo 	0: L: left
1: R: right
Quad 	0: L:  left
1: R:  right
2: SL: surround left
3: SR: surround right
5.1 	0: L:   left
1: R:   right
2: C:   center
3: LFE: subwoofer
4: SL:  surround left
5: SR:  surround right
When the amount of channels doesn't match between an input and an output, up- or down-mixing happens according the following rules:
Interpretation 	Input channels 	Output channels 	Mixing rules
speakers 	1 (Mono) 	2 (Stereo) 	Up-mix from mono to stereo.
The M input channel is used for both output channels (L and R).
output.L = input.M
output.R = input.M
1 (Mono) 	4 (Quad) 	Up-mix from mono to quad.
The M input channel is used for non-surround output channels (L and R). Surround output channels (SL and SR) are silent.
output.L  = input.M
output.R  = input.M
output.SL = 0
output.SR = 0
1 (Mono) 	6 (5.1) 	Up-mix from mono to 5.1.
The M input channel is used for the center output channel (C). All the others (L, R, LFE, SL, and SR) are silent.
output.L   = 0
output.R   = 0
output.C   = input.M
output.LFE = 0
output.SL  = 0
output.SR  = 0
2 (Stereo) 	1 (Mono) 	Down-mix from stereo to mono.
Both input channels (L and R) are equally combined to produce the unique output channel (M).
output.M = 0.5 * (input.L + input.R)
2 (Stereo) 	4 (Quad) 	Up-mix from stereo to quad.
The L and R input channels are used for their non-surround respective output channels (L and R). Surround output channels (SL and SR) are silent.
output.L  = input.L
output.R  = input.R
output.SL = 0
output.SR = 0
2 (Stereo) 	6 (5.1) 	Up-mix from stereo to 5.1.
The L and R input channels are used for their non-surround respective output channels (L and R). Surround output channels (SL and SR), as well as the center (C) and subwoofer (LFE) channels, are left silent.
output.L   = input.L
output.R   = input.R
output.C   = 0
output.LFE = 0
output.SL  = 0
output.SR  = 0
4 (Quad) 	1 (Mono) 	Down-mix from quad to mono.
All four input channels (L, R, SL, and SR) are equally combined to produce the unique output channel (M).
output.M = 0.25 * (input.L + input.R + input.SL + input.SR)
4 (Quad) 	2 (Stereo) 	Down-mix from quad to mono.
Both left input channels (L and SL) are equally combined to produce the unique left output channel (L). And similarly, both right input channels (R and SR) are equally combined to produce the unique right output channel (R).
output.L = 0.5 * (input.L + input.SL)
output.R = 0.5 * (input.R + input.SR)
4 (Quad) 	6 (5.1) 	Up-mix from quad to 5.1.
The L, R, SL, and SR input channels are used for their respective output channels (L and R). Center (C) and subwoofer (LFE) channels are left silent.
output.L   = input.L
output.R   = input.R
output.C   = 0
output.LFE = 0
output.SL  = input.SL
output.SR  = input.SR
6 (5.1) 	1 (Mono) 	Down-mix from 5.1 to stereo.
The left and right, both surround or not, and the central channels are all mixed together. The surround channels are slightly attenuated and the regular lateral channels are power-compensated to make them count as a single channel. The subwoofer (LFE) channel is lost.
output.M = 0.7071 * (input.L + input.R) + input.C + 0.5 * (input.SL + input.SR)
6 (5.1) 	2 (Stereo) 	Down-mix from 5.1 to stereo.
The central (C) is summed with each lateral surround channels (SL or SR) and mixed to each lateral channel. As it is mixed in two channels, it is mixed at lower power, that is they are multiplied by √2/2. The subwoofer (LFE) channel is lost.
output.L   = input.L + 0.7071 * (input.C + input.SL)
output.R   = input.R + 0.7071 * (input.C + input.SR)
6 (5.1) 	4 (Quad) 	Down-mix from 5.1 to quad.
The central (C) is mixed with the lateral non-surround channels (L and R). As it is mixed in two channels, it is mixed at lower power, that is they are multiplied by √2/2. The surround channels are passed unchanged. The subwoofer (LFE) channel is lost.
output.L   = input.L + 0.7071 * input.C
output.R   = input.R
output.SL  = input.SL
output.SR  = input.SR
Other 	As these are non-standard channel layout, they are handled as if channelInterpretation was set to discrete.
The specification explicitly allow the future definition of new speakers layout. This fallback is therefore not future proof as the behavior of the browsers for a specific amount of channels may change in the future.
discrete 	any (x) 	any (y) where x<y 	Up-mix discrete channels.
                                            Fill each output channel with its input counterpart, that is the input channel with the same index. Channels with no corresponding input channels are left silent.
                                            any (x) 	any (y) where x>y 	Down-mix discrete channels.
    Fill each output channel with its input counterpart, that is the input channel with the same index. Input channels with no corresponding output channels are dropped.
