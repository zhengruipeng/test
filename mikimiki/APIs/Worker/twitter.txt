Worker API(lighting)

This event-base API is used to mount threads on JS to perform complex operations
You can check the calculation results by sending and receiving information
↓↓↓

1:
Pass the JS thread path into the worker constructor to initialize the new thread
let worker = new Worker(url);
You can send messages to or receive messages from sub threads
worker.onmessage = function (e){
  console.log(e.data);
};
worker.postMessage("message")

2:
In most browsers' implementation of worker, they really mount a new thread to perform operations
But you should not use them to perform audio and graphics operations,
because they have their own worklets and shaders
