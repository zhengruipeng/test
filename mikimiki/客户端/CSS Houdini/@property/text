the @property rule in CSS and javascript(lighting)

An important API was drafted in 2018 ---- CSS Houdini
this API has defined some concepts of CSS engine and operation between javascript and CSS
and the @property rule in CSS and JS is one of them.
↓↓↓

in CSS, you can define a property like this:
--foo:10px;
--bar:#fff;
but, the details of these properties are not clearly,
and CSS engine can't use transition in it.

you can formally define a CSS property with this new API,
nowadays, there are 3 details allow to override, they are syntax,inherits,initial-value;
I think initial-value is the easiest one in them.
It mains the initial value of the property,
yes! as same as the word says.

inherits aimed if the property can be inherited, the valid values are true or false
please don't forget the "s" after the word "inherits"!!
syntax is the type of the property which contains all of the valid type in CSS standard.
this is the most important and most difficult one in them,
if you want to write a color value into property (such as #fff), the syntax of the property is "<color>"
and "<length>" when you write 30px...

The most difficult of syntax to understand are resolution
Resolution is not common in CSS, they are usually used in media-query
(see also:https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@media)

you can defined them in CSS:
@property --property-name {
  syntax: '<color>';
  inherits: false;
  initial-value: blue;
}
or in JS:
window.CSS.registerProperty({
  name: '--property-name',
  syntax: '<color>',
  inherits: false,
  initialValue: 'blue',
});
